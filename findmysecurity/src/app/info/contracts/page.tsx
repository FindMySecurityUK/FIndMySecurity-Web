        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Before engaging a security professional for a role whether ad hoc, part-time, or full-time, it is essential to have a written employment contract in place. This should detail the scope of the role, terms of employment, and conditions both parties agree to.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Under UK employment law, employers must provide a written statement of employment particulars on or before the first day of work (Employment Rights Act 1996, as amended April 2020). A comprehensive contract is strongly advised to protect both parties.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Signing the Agreement</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The contract must be signed and dated by both parties, with a copy retained by each. Verbal agreements are not sufficient and do not protect either party if a dispute arises.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Flexible or Zero-Hour Arrangements</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Yes—zero-hour contracts are permitted for SIA-licensed security professionals. They are legal and can be appropriate for:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>On-call or ad-hoc assignments</li>
          <li>Event-based work</li>
          <li>Cover shifts or temporary engagements</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          However, employees on zero-hour contracts are still entitled to the National Minimum Wage, paid annual leave, and protection from unfair dismissal. Exclusivity clauses (i.e., preventing them from working elsewhere) are not allowed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          Always review shift patterns periodically to ensure a zero-hour contract remains appropriate and does not mask what is essentially regular work.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Payroll Support</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Managing deductions, HMRC submissions, and pension enrolment can be complex. Many employers choose to use payroll providers who also offer compliant contract templates tailored to private security employment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Summary</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          A clear, fair, and legally compliant employment contract benefits everyone involved. It builds trust, defines expectations, and ensures your security professional is protected and properly compensated.
