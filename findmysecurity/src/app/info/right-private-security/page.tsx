        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Why choose a short-term or on-call security officer?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          For many individuals, businesses, or families, a flexible security arrangement offers peace of mind without the commitment of full-time staff. Whether it’s for a single evening, a weekend event, or an emergency absence cover, on-call security officers provide:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>Personal protection when travelling or hosting</li>
          <li>Property safeguarding during absences</li>
          <li>Event security for private functions</li>
          <li>Concierge services at luxury venues</li>
          <li>Residential or estate monitoring</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">What makes a good personal or ad hoc security officer?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          The best security professionals demonstrate not only experience and licensing, but also the interpersonal qualities needed to inspire trust and handle situations discreetly and professionally.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">When reviewing applicants, consider the following:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>SIA Licence – Ensure the officer holds a valid Security Industry Authority licence relevant to your needs (e.g. Door Supervisor, Close Protection, CCTV).</li>
          <li>Enhanced DBS Check – Especially important for residential or family-based security.</li>
          <li>Relevant Experience – Look for officers who’ve worked in similar environments (e.g. residential security, corporate events, executive protection).</li>
          <li>Training & Certifications – First aid, conflict management, risk assessment, and customer service training are all valuable.</li>
          <li>References – Always request and follow up on at least two references from prior clients or employers.</li>
        </ul>

          To ensure expectations are met and safety is prioritised, establish clear ground rules and practical arrangements:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>Are they confident handling the age or profile of those present (e.g. children, elderly clients, VIPs)?</li>
          <li>Do they drive, and is secure transport required or provided?</li>
          <li>Do they understand any special requirements (e.g. access codes, pet awareness, CCTV usage)?</li>
          <li>Are they able to work independently and follow strict confidentiality protocols?</li>
          <li>Do they understand the layout of the property or venue?</li>
          <li>Can they reach you and emergency services quickly if needed?</li>
